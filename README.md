============


## about

```
require('beer')
require('javascript')
developers.filter((dev) => { return distance(dev.loc, paloAlto.loc) < 20; }).forEach(inviteForBeer);
// frequent, informal discussions of various things javascript in a beer-enriched environment.
// 'cause the city's too far, and CalTrain stops running too early.
```

We meet monthly at Rose & Crown. We have a [group on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/beer-js-palo-alto/). Open a GitHub issue to propose a meetup, ask questions of the group, or general discussion.
